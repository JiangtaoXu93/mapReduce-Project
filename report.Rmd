###<span style = "color:#588bae">Objective</span> 
Given a download dataset, try to make a machine learning model to predict downloads based on several dataset.

###<span style = "color:#588bae">Preparing Data</span>
 - Inferred some missing values in songInfo. 
 - Aggregated Jam and number times a song been played on songs.
 - Some pre-processing on artist name and song title, so that after joining the 2 tables, we don't lost too much information.
 
###<span style = "color:#588bae">Obtaining Dataset</span>
-  General idea: inner joint 2 tables: song_info and donwloads on artist name and song title.
-  Left joint Jam and taste: fill in 0 with the missing values. We think this assumption is valid because if a song never show up in these tables, most likely nobody likes them and nobody has played it. Our model accuracy partly endorse this assumption.

###<span style = "color:#588bae">Implementation</span>
-  We make use of the dataframe in spark to make efficient join.

###<span style = "color:#588bae">Choosing Features</span>
-  Explanation of the features that we chosed.

###<span style = "color:#588bae">Model Selection</span>
-  Trying with different model and the result.


###<span style = "color:#588bae">Machine Learning Implementation</span>
-  Spark ML
